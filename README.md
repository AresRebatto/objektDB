## Introduction
**objektDB** is a lightweight, easy-to-use embedded object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) for Rust projects. It allows you to store, retrieve, and manage structured objects directly, preserving their relationships and hierarchies without the need for external database servers. Ideal for small applications, prototyping, or learning purposes, objektDB offers Rust developers persistent object storage with minimal setup and a straightforward API.

## Importing the Crate

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]

Then import it in your Rust code:

```rust
use objektdb;
```
